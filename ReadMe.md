//What the project does//

This project allows you to access gifs related to DC Comic Book Characters. It also allows users to create their own buttons for their favorite DC characters.

//Why the project is useful//
It is a one stop shop for users to obtain DC Character specific gifs. It is useful for me as it teaches me how to include APIs on a page.

//How users can get started with the project//
Users simply have to click the buttons with the various character names. Ten gifs will automatically populate upon each click of a button. Additionally, users will be able to create their own button by typing a name in the input field.

Point of contact for this project is Aimee Bojorquez.
